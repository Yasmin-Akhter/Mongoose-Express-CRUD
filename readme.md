# [MONGOOSE CRUD MASTERING](https://express-mongoose-crud-flax.vercel.app/)

It is an ``express project``,in which I used ``Mongoose CRUD mechanism and Typescript`` to make an user application.Here we can

- create user,
- store them in MongoDB,
- update user
- find single user
- delete user from DB  
I added an order properties of user, where user's ordered products details will be shown.
User can see-
- total order
- total price
- can find single order details  
I have used ``Zod validation system`` to validate the input values while creating user. 
### Some important instructions to run this application locally
